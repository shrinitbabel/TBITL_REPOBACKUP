# Machine Learning Project Ideas for Traumatic Brain Injury Dataset

This repository includes two sources of TBI data:

- **Jordan pediatric dataset** – 112 records with 42 clinical fields.
- **TITCO India dataset** – 16,000 trauma episodes (7,978 with intracranial injuries after filtering on CT ICD codes).

Together these data contain demographics, accident details, vitals, imaging findings, interventions and outcomes.

Below are potential machine learning projects that could be developed using these data, along with suggestions for gathering additional data or applying transfer learning from publicly available models.

## 1. TBI Outcome Prediction

- **Goal**: Predict patient outcome (survival and mental status at discharge) from initial presentation data such as demographics, accident details, ER vitals, and radiology findings.
- **Approach**: Train logistic regression or gradient boosting models. Given the small dataset, use cross-validation and regularization.
- **Extensions**: Incorporate additional TBI datasets (e.g., from public repositories like physionet) to improve generalization. Compare with published prognostic models such as IMPACT or CRASH.

## 2. Feature Importance Analysis

- **Goal**: Identify which clinical variables are most predictive of poor versus good outcome.
- **Approach**: Train tree-based models (e.g., random forest, XGBoost) and compute feature importances or SHAP values. This helps clinicians understand which factors contribute most to patient prognosis.

## 3. Clustering for Patient Stratification

- **Goal**: Group TBI cases into clusters representing different injury patterns or severities.
- **Approach**: Perform dimensionality reduction (t-SNE, UMAP, or PCA) followed by k-means or hierarchical clustering. Analyze clusters to see if they correspond to known TBI categories or reveal new subtypes.

## 4. Time-to-Event Modeling

- **Goal**: Model length of hospital stay or time to discharge using survival analysis techniques.
- **Approach**: Apply Cox proportional hazards models or survival forests. This can provide insight into factors affecting recovery time.

## 5. Transfer Learning with Imaging Models

- **Goal**: Explore transfer learning using pre-trained medical imaging models on the radiology findings (CT images if available) to predict TBI severity or outcome.
- **Approach**: If the original imaging is available, leverage open-source models (e.g., the 3D U-Net from the MedicalNet project on GitHub) and fine-tune on local data. Due to dataset size, use data augmentation and pre-trained weights.

## 6. Explainable AI for TBI Management

- **Goal**: Build interpretable models that provide transparent recommendations for clinical decision making (e.g., ICU admission or neurosurgery).
- **Approach**: Combine simple rule-based models with modern explainability techniques like SHAP, LIME, or interpretable tree ensembles to ensure clinicians can trust model outputs.

## 7. Benchmarking with External Datasets

- **Goal**: Compare model performance on this dataset with publicly available TBI datasets, such as the TRACK-TBI open dataset or data from PhysioNet.
- **Approach**: Train on the external dataset and evaluate on this dataset (transfer learning) or vice versa. Assess generalizability.

## 8. Data Quality and Imputation Study

- **Goal**: Investigate missing or inconsistent data patterns and assess how imputation strategies influence model performance.
- **Approach**: Compare simple imputation methods (mean, median) with advanced techniques (multivariate imputation by chained equations). Measure downstream effects on outcome prediction.
